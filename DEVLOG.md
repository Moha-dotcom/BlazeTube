**Today's Progress:**
- Implemented JWT-based authentication system.
- Created `authenticateToken` middleware to protect routes.
- Tested login, register, and profile routes using Postman.

##Dev Log – Video Upload System

Date: 2025-10-27

Tasks Completed
	1.	Investigated and Chose Video Storage Approach
	•	Attempted storing videos directly in MySQL → caused memory/performance issues.
	•	Tried writing temp .txt files → inefficient and unnecessary.
	•	Decided on Filebase (S3-compatible cloud storage) for scalable and efficient video storage.
	2.	Implemented File Upload via Multer
	•	Set up upload.single("videoPath") for receiving files from Postman/form-data requests.
	•	Captured video metadata from req.file (original name, MIME type, size, temp path).
	3.	Streamed Videos to Filebase
	•	Generated unique storage keys using UUID + original filename to handle duplicates.
	•	Streamed files directly from Multer’s temp storage to Filebase without loading the entire file into memory.
	•	Configured S3 client (AWS.S3) with correct .env credentials and bucket name.
	•	Verified upload success with Filebase returning the video URL.
	4.	Saved Metadata in MySQL
	•	Stored only essential information: video_name, user_id, video_key, video_url, size, mime_type.
	•	Ensured large video files are not stored in the database, keeping operations lightweight.
	5.	Key Fixes & Lessons Learned
	•	Fixed MissingRequiredParameter: Bucket error by using string bucket name from .env.
	•	Properly exported fileBaseStorage client to avoid undefined references.
	•	Ensured temporary files are deleted after successful upload.
	•	Prepared system to handle duplicate filenames safely via unique keys.
